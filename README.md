Project: Solar Panel Condition Classification and Object Detection
This project aims to automate the detection of issues on solar panels, improving efficiency and reducing maintenance costs. The objective is to:

Classify solar panel images into six categories: Clean, Dusty, Bird-Drop, Electrical-Damage, Physical-Damage, and Snow-Covered.

Detect and localize obstructions or damages like dust, bird droppings, and physical/electrical damage using object detection models.
